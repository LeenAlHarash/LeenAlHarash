- **Python**: For scripting, automation, and application development.
- **PHP**: For server-side web development.
- **Java EE & Java SE**: For building cross-platform applications.
- **SQL**: For managing and querying data in relational databases.
- **Kotlin**: For modern, expressive programming, often used for Android app development.
- **C#**: For building Windows applications, web services, and cross-platform applications using .NET.  


## Frameworks
- **Spring Boot**: A Java-based framework that simplifies the creation of production-ready back-end applications and APIs using the Spring ecosystem.
- **Angular**: A front-end TypeScript framework used to build dynamic and responsive single-page web applications (SPAs).
- **ASP.NET Core**: For developing modern, fast, and scalable web APIs and applications.


## Other Skills
